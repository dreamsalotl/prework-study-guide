# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was made as a resource to help students during the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I built this project in hopes that it clearly and easily outlines the basics of web development.

## Usage

Each section of this Study Guide has notes that should help anyone understand the basics of web development. Included topics are HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open the DevTools console, `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows) or `Command + Option + I` (MacOS), not only can you see JavaScript in action, but it will even recommend you a topic to start on!
